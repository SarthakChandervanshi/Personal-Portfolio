# Sarthak's - Personal Portfolio

This is my fully responsive personal portfolio website responsive for all devices, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To ensure code quality and version control, I used Git and GitHub. I leveraged Git's branching and merging capabilities to manage different features and bug fixes separately, ensuring smooth collaboration with my team. Additionally, I regularly committed changes to GitHub, making it easy to roll back to previous versions if needed.

The website is optimized for search engines and features clean, semantic HTML markup and CSS classes. The site has been tested for cross-browser compatibility, ensuring that it works well on different browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
